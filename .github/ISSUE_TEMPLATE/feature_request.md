## What's the problem?

-   What is the task, goal, or need this request would help someone accomplish?
-   What is the context or scenario in which they would experience it?
-   Who is the group of people who would be in this situation?
-   What is it about the current design that makes the need above hard to satisfy?

If what you're describing above is broken functionality, including usability, accessibility, localization problems, report those as defects, as they are things to be fixed, not added.

## What's the design idea?

What do you propose to change or add to address the problem above? Describe some functionality, a design concept, a redesign, or alternative designs that might address the problem. Provide as much detail about the idea as you currently have, but no need to provide an exact design specification if you don't have one. (That goes below).

## Design specification

_Reporters can leave this blank. Designers should write a detailed, precise description of what is to be built. If images are necessary to convey this precisely, make sure to include image descriptions, so everyone can see what is in the image. Do not link to external documents; everything should be embedded here. Once the design is approved, we will remove the `needs design` tag and replace it with the `buildable` tag, signalling that it can be built._
