I once had a director that wanted to check if a number was even (divisible by 2, I think that means?), and so they wrote this. This is a function called \\even\\ that takes a single number called… \\number\\. You need to tell me what kind of value each input is, so @Evaluate can make sure that anything evaluating the function is sending the right kind of value. Then, it takes the number, divides it by two, gets the remainder (with the @Number/remainder), and then checks if the remainder is equal to \\0\\, with @Number/equal. So the whole function ends up either evaluating to \\⊤\\ or \\⊥\\. For example, this evaluation of even evaluated to \\⊥\\ because \\3\\ is odd. Try using the rewind buttons to see how it works."

I tidy things, to make them easier to understand, by giving reusable concepts names. So imagine instead of all of these @Bind, we instead make one of me, and name it \\Marquee\\?

Now it just says the initial value is a marquee with the five messages and the next value, after each clock tick, is the next message. Simpler, right? That's because all of the logic for next messages is in \\next()\\, which just makes a new \\Marquee\\ with the same messages, but an updated index. We also get some benefits in the two @Phrase.
