Follow me? The sequence has four steps. Straight, tilt left, tilt right, straight. When @Phrase enters, they do this cute little wobble, and then stop. I work with @MapLiteral to map percentages to a @Pose. Each of those percentages are how far through the sequence each @Pose should happen.

You need to tell me what kind of value each input is, so @Evaluate can make sure that anything evaluating the function is sending the right kind of value.
