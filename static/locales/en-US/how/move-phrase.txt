Make a character moveable

Sometimes its helpful to make a @Phrase moveable with a keyboard, mouse, or finger.

Do do this, we can combine @Phrase with @Placement:

\
Stage(
	[Phrase('move me' place: Placement())]
	place: Place(0m 0m -10m)
)
\

Using the keyboard arrows or clicking on the @Stage will update the @Placement, causing the @Phrase to move in that direction.

Did you know, though, that @Placement can be used with /anything/ that takes a @Place? 
For example a @Stage has a @Place that determmines where it's camera is pointing.
Let's try setting a @Placement for a @Stage's place, and see what happens.

\
Stage(
  [
	Phrase('🐈' place: Place(-2m 2m))
	Phrase('🐈' place: Place(2m -2m))
	Phrase('🐈' place: Place(-1m 3m))
  ]
  place: Placement(Place(0m 0m -10m))
)
\

That makes the camera move! (Note: we start the @Placement with a \z\ value of \10m\ so that the camera is set back from everything.)
