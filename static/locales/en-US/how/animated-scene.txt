Create an animated series of scenes

Sometimes we want to tell stories, show lyrics, or animate poetry.
To do that, we can use @Scene and @Phrase together, to show a sequence.

For example, imagine we wanted to animate the short nursery rhyme, "Jack be Nimble".
We could make a @Scene that has each line as a @Phrase, and by setting the @Phrase/duration of each line, the @Scene would advance when each phrase is done.

\
Scene([
  Phrase('Jack be nimble' duration: 1s)
  Phrase('Jack be quick' duration: 1s)
  Phrase('Jack jump over the candle stick' duration: 1s)
])
\

@Scene will wait for a @Sequence to be done too. Let's make the candle line jump!

\
Scene([
		Phrase('Jack be nimble' duration: 1s)
		Phrase('Jack be quick' duration: 1s)
		Phrase('Jack jump over the candle stick' entering: Sequence(bounce() 1s))
	])
\

@Scene can also take a @Group of text too, and it will wait for all its content to finish animation.

\
Scene([
		Group(Stack() [
      Phrase('Jack be nimble')
		  Phrase('Jack be quick')
    ] duration: 2s)
		Phrase('Jack jump over the candle stick' entering: Sequence(bounce() 1s))
	])
\
