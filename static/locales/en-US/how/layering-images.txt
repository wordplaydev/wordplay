Layer Images Over Each Other

Sometimes we want to layer images to build fun scenes or creative shapes.

For example, you can use multiple layers your project on @Stage to stack and arrange images however you like.

Look! Here's a turtle I made using just shapes!
Try changing the numbers for each shape. You can move them, resize them, and even rotate them.
Play around and see what you can create!

¶Note: Check out the gallery for another project <example@https://wordplay.dev/project/example-Layers?play> of layering images.¶


Stage(
	[
		Shape(Circle(3m 0m 1m 0m))
		Shape(Polygon(2m 3 0m -12m 0m) rotation: -30°)
		Shape(Polygon(7m 6 0m -6m 0m))
		Shape(Rectangle(-11m -9m 11m -12m 10m) rotation: 25°)
		Shape(Rectangle(-11m -9m 11m -12m 10m) rotation: -25°)

	]
	place: Place(0m 10m -30m)
)

You could make some really cool stuff with layers! Try it out!
