Create an interactive series of scenes

Sometimes we want to tell stories that wait for the viewer to do something before going to the next content.

To do this, we can use a @Scene, but put @Boolean values between the content we want to show. For example, here's a click will advance to each next content, using a @Button:

\
Scene([
		Phrase('click me')
		Button()
		Phrase('click me again' duration: 1s)
		Button()
		Phrase('no really, click me as hard as you can!!' duration: 1s)
		Button()
		Phrase('have you clicked me yet?' duration: 1s)
	])
\

The @Scene shows the first @Phrase, then waits for the @Button to be true, and once it is, it advances to the next @Phrase.

You can use anything you want to advance, as long as it's either true or false. 
For example, we could use our voice! 
If we yell loud enough, the scene will advance:

\
Scene([
		Phrase('is anyone there?')
		Volume() > .5
		Phrase("I can't hear you, say again?" duration: 1s)
		Volume() > .7
		Phrase('louder please...' duration: 1s)
		Volume() > .9
		Phrase('oh, hi!' duration: 1s)
	])
\
