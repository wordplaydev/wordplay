Make a character shake

Sometimes it's helpful to have a character look like it's shaking.
There are a few ways we can make that happen.

We can use @Phrase/offset with @Random and @Time to make that happen.

\
offset: 0m … ∆ Time() … Random(-0.1m 0.1m)
Phrase('hi' offset: Place(offset 0m))
\

This creates a value called \offset\ that changes to a new random value each time the clock ticks.
Then, it uses that offset to show the @Phrase offset by that amount.

If we wanted to control the shaking more precisely, we could use a @Sequence to make a random shaking animation that repeats.

\
Phrase('hi' resting: Sequence({
			0%: Pose(offset: Place(Random(-.2m .2m)))
			15%: Pose(offset: Place(Random(-.2m .2m)))
			60%: Pose(offset: Place(Random(-.2m .2m)))
			75%: Pose(offset: Place(Random(-.2m .2m)))
		} 0.1s))
\

This example just picks random values once, but turns them into a repeating sequence.
