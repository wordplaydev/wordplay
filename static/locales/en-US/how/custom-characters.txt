Show a custom character

Emojis, letters, and symbols are great! But sometimes you want to make your own characters.
How can you create and show your own?

First, start by creating a character on the <Characters@://characters> page. 
You can use pixels, rectangles, circles, and paths. 
Give it a name, describe it, and then you can use your user name and the character name like this:

\
Phrase(`Look at my fancy @username/charactername!`)
\

That username and character name doesn't exist, so it will show as an empty rectangle.
Be sure to use your actual user name and character name

See how the text uses the backtick instead of a quote symbol? That's important. 
That's telling us that you're using rich text mode, and that's required to refer to a custom character.
