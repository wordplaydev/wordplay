Repeating a movement

Sometimes we want to make a character move the same way several times! 
Typing out the same lines over and over again came become tedious.

Instead, we can use @Sequence with @Phrase to make something repeat multiple times! Specifically,
we can use the count in @Sequence and choose how many times a set of poses happens. For example, 
here's a basketball bouncing up and down twice. 

\
Stage([
	Phrase('üèÄ' entering: Sequence({
				0%: Pose(offset: Place(y: 0.25m))
				25%: Pose(offset: Place(y: 0m))
				50%: Pose(offset: Place(y: -0.25m))
				75%: Pose(offset: Place(y: 0m))
				100%: Pose(offset: Place(y: 0.25m))} count:2x duration:2s))
])
