Create a video from the camera

The @Camera stream is a great way to get a grid of colors from the world. 
What if we want to see those colors, recreating the image the @Camera sees?

We can use the @Grid layout for a @Group, and @List/combine function to convert the colors into a list of @Phrase that we give to the @Grid.

\
width: 24
height: 24
colors: Camera(width · 1px height · 1px 33ms)
Stage([
		Group(Grid(height width 0m) colors.combine([] ƒ(phrases row) [
						:phrases
						:row.translate(ƒ(color) Phrase("⬤" color: color duration: 0s))
					]))
	])
\

This example builds a list of phrases, coverting each color into a circle with the specific color.

Be careful with @Camera streams: they produce a lot of input! You'll want to keep the width and height of the image small.
