Make a character animate

Characters can have a resting animation that repeats while they aren't moving.

For example, let's make this cat dance a little bit by making it rotate and shift:

\
Phrase(
    '🐈' 
    resting: Sequence({
        0%: Pose(rotation: 0°)
        15%: Pose(rotation: 15°)
        30%: Pose(rotation: 0°)
        45%: Pose(offset: Place(-0.25m))
        60%: Pose(offset: Place(0.25m))
        75%: Pose(offset: Place(-0.25m))
        90%: Pose(offset: Place(0m))
    } 2s)
)
\

This example uses a @Sequence of different @Pose.
