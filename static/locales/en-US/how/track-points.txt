Keep track of points

Sometimes in a game, it's helpful to keep track of points when something happens. If Wordplay doesn't permit variables to be given new values, how can we do that?

The trick is to use a @Reaction to define a @Bind's value, and to think carefully about what event should result in a new value for the @Bind.

For example, imagine very simple game where a player gets more points each time they type a secret key on the keyboard. 

\
points: 0 … ['a' 'e' 'i' 'o' 'u'].has(Key()) … points + 1
\

This example says, /Points starts at 0, and then every time a key is pressed, if the key is in the list of vowels, points becomes the current points plus one./ Each time the \Key()\ @Stream changes, the program reevaluates, checks the condition, and if it is true, gives \points\ a new value.

There are three parts to a reaction in this:

• The initial value for points (\0\)
• The condition that, when true, produces a new value (\['a' 'e' 'i' 'o' 'u'].has(Key())\)
• The new value, if the condition becomes true (\points + 1\)

To make more sophisticated point tracking, just make more sophisticed conditions or new values. Take some time to think through the rules of those conditions and new values, and then try to express them in code.
