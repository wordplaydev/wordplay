# Hi helper!

Welcome! You must be here to make programming accessible to everyone in the world, regardless of language or ability. We're excited to have your help!

This document is your guide for several types of contributions, including development, verification, localization, and more. We don't have documentation for every role yet, but we're working on it.

## Commit to our Principles

Before getting started, ther are several key principles we expect you to follow when contributing to the project:

-   **Be kind**. Not only to everyone else contributing, but to anyone who expresses interest in helping, and to everyone who uses the platform. This is not a place to gatekeep, shame, or criticize, its a place to learn, grow, and affirm. We want everyone who engages here to leave feeling smarter, more capable, more welcome, and more valued.
-   **Attend to the details**. Don't take shorcuts or ignore design details; work on them, or detail the work to be done for later. This is not only important in any engineering and design work, which demands attention to detail in both building and verification, but it also matters greatly for our projects goals of decolonization, justice, and equity in programming. Details of the mundane are where many are where injustice often lives, because it's easiest to ignore.
-   **Deviate consciously**. This project as a large number of established architectural and interaction design patterns. Most of them were very consciously chosen to support some design goal; some may have been accidents or not well thought through. Before you begin design or engineering work, study how things have been done, and do them like that. And if you find yourself wanting to deviates from other other things work, pause talk to others, and make sure that the deviation is a good idea. Don't deviate just because it's the shortest path.
-   **Learn from each other**. While Amy is leading, and is a teacher, everyone else in this community is a key source of knowledge too. Write questions in Slack, teach each other, challenge each other to do better. The project relies on everyone to be a source of knowledge and expertise to be successful.

## Setup (~0.5 hours)

Before you can contribute, there are several things you need to install and configure in order to run Wordplay on your device:

[Setup](contributing/setup.md)

After you're done with those, come back here!

## Learn (~1-2 hours)

Now that you're set up, there are a few things you should start with:

1.  Go through the Wordplay tutorial to learn the language and get used to the interface.
2.  Make a few Wordplay programs to get used to what's possible to create with it.
3.  Ask question in #wordplay about things you don't understand. The tutorial isn't perfect, so asking questions is good; it helps us identify gaps in the tutorial so we can improve it.

This guide is always evolving, so [write Amy](mailto:ajko@uw.edu) if you have ideas for how to improve it.

## Choose a role (~1 hour)

There are many ways to contribute to the project. Here are the roles we've sketched out so far:

-   [Design](contributing/design.md)
-   [Development](contributing/development.md)
-   [Verification](contributing/verification.md)
-   [Localization](contributing/localization.md)
-   [Curation](contributing/curation.md)
-   [Management](contributing/management.md)

Pick one of those, carefully read through all of it, ask questions in #wordplay about it. If it sounds like something you want to do, or learn to do, then:

1. Find the corresponding team [on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/wordplaydev/teams) and send a request to join it.
2. Follow the guidance in the corresponding document above to contribute.

It's okay to be overwhelmed at this point. There's a lot to learn, but that's okay! You've got a whole community of people here ot help.

And if you want to do something else, talk to Amy and we'll figure it out!
