# Curating

We're so excited to have your help curating great examples! This role is all about writing Wordplay performances that illustrate how to use Wordplay, share useful design patterns, and illustrate the platforms principles (accessibility, localization, playfulness).

Creating performances entails:

1. Envisioning a performance that complements the performances in your curated galleries.
2. Implementing, documenting, and debugging it
3. Ensuring that names and it's fully localized into at least two languages
4. Ensuring that it's accessible
5. Choosing a gallery for it
6. Publishing it

You can talk to Amy to decide whether it should be a built in example or whether it should live in the database.
Built in exmaples are part of the verification infastructure, and help ensure Wordplay is working as intended.
Database examples aren't, but help enrich the collection of examples.
