# Manager

So you want to help manage the project? That's great! There's a lot to manage.

There's no general sequence to management, but here are the activities involved. It's up to you to be proactive to do the ones that seem important, and to tightly coordinate with Amy and other managers to make sure that the management work you're doing is valuable. You might choose one of these to focus on, or do all of them.

-   **Ensuring that our collection of _issues_ are properly tagged and triaged**. This means clarifying issues that are submitted, gathering more information about them, giving them proper tags to manage their status. This is more than just tidying; our issue set is the ground truth of work to be done and a key source of coordination between our community's different roles. Keeping it consistent, up to date is essential to the project's ongoing success.
-   **Recruiting and coordinating work of those in other roles**. Suppose there's an issue that's particularly important, but has no one to work on it. Find designers, developers, and verifiers to help with it, building a team and making sure they're working together successfully.
-   **Identifying gaps in the organization**. This might be gaps in onboarding documentation, gaps in knowledge, gaps in expertise, gaps in products. Addressing these could mean improving infrastructure or creating new infrastructure, changing our collaboration processes, or helping to recruit people or raise funding with Amy.
