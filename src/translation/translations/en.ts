                I love names. 
                I name things. 
                Can I name you? 
                Do you have something I can name? 
                Give me an expression and I'll name it!
                I name inputs to @FunctionDefinition and @StructureDefinition, I name values in @Block. I name everything!

                Why name something?
                Well, some of us are fine without a name because we collaborate so closely.
                But sometimes its helpful to give us names so you can refer to us by name instead.
                
                Be careful with names though: once I name a value, it will *always* have that value.
                And also don't like it when multiple things have the same name.
                That just gets confusing.
                One name, one value!

                Oh, but did you know you can have one value *many names*?
                I'm s excited to tell you about this!
                One value, many names. For example:

                (joe,tess,amy: 5)

                See what I did there? 
                One value, three names.
                You can refer to that five by *any* of those names.
                This is especially when you want to give names in many languages:

                (joe/en,aimee/fr,明/zh: 5)

                See what I did *there*? 
                Three names for one value, just in different languages!

                Okay, I have one last secret.
                Did you know that you can tell me what kind of value a name should have, and if it doesn't have it, I will tell you?
                Like this:

                (bignumber•#: "one zillion")

                See, I said (bignumber) should be a number, but it's text, and those aren't compatible and so BOOM!
                I'll let you know if they disagree.
                Sometimes you might *have* to tell me what kind of data something else because I can't figure it out myself.

                space to temporarily name complicated things.
                @Bind names them, and I keep track of all the names
                and evaluate to whatever value was last.

                )

                @Bind just went on and on and on, spelling out the whole alphabet and numbering
                them and I was just like "*Can you just give me 26? You didn't even use any of those names. I could have just passed on 26 and we would have been done.*" 
                Why do you have to name them all?

            Did you ever think about how we decide?

            @BooleanLiteral helps see that I could reduce everything to just two options: (${TRUE_SYMBOL}) and (${FALSE_SYMBOL}).
            If it's (${TRUE_SYMBOL}), then I evaluate my *yes* code. If it's (${FALSE_SYMBOL}), then I evaluate my *no* code.

            I know that decisions are rarely this simple, but breaking down the world into these two options makes things easier for me.
