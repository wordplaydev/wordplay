# History

Back in 2022 when Amy was preparing for sabbatical, she started writing a [specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTAuU0qyfp09SifNUaZ_tbQXbSgunSLfZLBRkeWf_Fo/edit#heading=h.l2lzf5ih38l1).
It contains most of the major ideas for the platform and was a guide for its design and development.
Of course, ideas drift, so it's not exactly what she built, but it is pretty close.
